## 1. Overview

### For the purpose of practicing my HTML/CSS/JS skills, I've created this website basically copying the existing "momentum" chrome extension.

<br>

### Since the purpose of the project is to practice my HTML/CSS/JS skills, I deliberately haven't used any other helping tools like jQuery or Bootstrap etc except for tasking some icons from font-awesome website. For the structure, I mainly followed MVC Pattern.

### ~~(Yes, I ended up building my own crappy Bootstrap and React ðŸ‘½)~~

## 2. Features

### Since the original have too many features, I selected a few core features of the original as follows:

1. Search via Search Engines [Google, Bing, Duckduckgo]
   - You can do a search with one of 3 famous search engines through the website.
2. Weather App
   - You can check the weather [current / weekly (upcoming 4 days)] of your location.
   - You can search for a location by its name and check its weather, too.
3. Time Clock with Today's Focus
   - You can check a time and switch between 12 hour / 24 hour modes.
   - You can set your main focus for today.
4. Quote App
   - You can see an inspiring quote down bottom on the website.
   - You can also check who said it by hovering over the quote.
5. Todo App
   - You can create/read/update/delete tasks.
   - You can manage tasks by 3 available categories (Inbox/Today/Done)
6. Responsiveness
   - It supports 3 differently sized viewports
     - lg > 1250px
     - md > 950px
     - sm > 685px
   - Sadly, it does not support for mobile size viewport.

## 3. Retrospective

### It was definitely not easy to make everything from the scratch without any supports from the 3rd party libraries etc.

<br>

### With CSS, I felt like I'm creating my own bootstrap and I struggled a lot creating my own CSS components with nitty-gritty details and managing them programatically. Also, unexpectedly, it was very hard for me to name tons of css classes systemically(?)

<br>

### With JS, I also felt like I'm creating my own React since i had to manually implement all rendering logics of each component and manage the states of each component. It was not easy, but i think it was worthwhile to try it out since now i think i can understand React much better than before and especially understand how React can easily saves us from managing all the tricky parts.
